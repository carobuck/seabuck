Processing the deep MOCNESS took a while so that meant I went to bed at about 0500. And completely forgot that we have weekly drills aboard ship so that was a pleasant little alarm to wake up to just past noon. I suppose it was a realistic experience having to wake up bleary eyed and pull on long pants, long shirt, hat, and grab my go-bag and life jacket.^[I was a little late to muster, so I'll need to be speedier next time. Though ideally I won't also be using the drill as my wake-up call.]

Absolutely went back to bed right after the drill, then when I got up a second time, we hung out, played cribbage,^[I won with a stellar 17 point hand at the end.] read books, etc. 

Rallying for dinner in a few minutes, then it'll be time for some nets! Woohoo!^[No MOCNESS tonight though, so it won't be quite so late a night. Phew.]

*Sea fun fact of the day:* We are on a *ship* not a boat. A boat is something^[smaller aquatic craft] you put on a ship.
