Longest day ever where I went to bed Thurs Mar 14th at 1:30am^[so this counts as going to bed on "Wednesday"], slept, got up in time for lunch, then stayed up through breakfast on Friday morning^[which kinda felt like going to bed on "Thursday"]. And now I write this and it's still Friday? Somehow? My body is so confused what day it is at this point and my brain doesn't even bother trying to keep track of what day it is. We've only got a couple more days on ship before we're back in San Diego anyways, and I figure I can sort out mundanities like day of week then. 

But we've got some exciting^[some more exciting than others] things to catch up on. 

- So many whales^[photographing whales is hard so check them out in this [video](https://photos.app.goo.gl/VdWmUFT8Ve26k91i7), especially the first 20ish seconds] in the afternoon! 
- Reading on deck in the sunshine when the wind isn't terribly strong is truly top-tier. Highly recommend.^[You may get to a point though where you keep jumping up and down to see whales, and after a while... you almost feel like you've seen all the whales and don't have to jump up again. But then you shake yourself back to reality and remember: YOU'RE LITERALLY ON A SHIP LOOKING AT WHALES HARDLY 50M FROM THE SHIP AND YOU MUST PINCH YOURSELF THAT THIS IS REAL. And of course you'll keep jumping up every time someone spots a whale. Also whales are really big.]
- I will be celebrating belated pi(e) day when back on land. Need me a good GF crust. Richard did make Minerva and I a "special" dessert though^[Chocolate covered chickpeas. Which weren't bad, certainly were as advertised, and I would have again in life I suppose]
- We caught another octopus! This time a big one! Maybe a lady octo?? So either Leroy III or Leona/Lyra.^[I think Leona is a better name, but I was out-voted in the lab and they liked Lyra better] Very exciting to hold a bigger friend, and actually feel the suction power!!^[I may have reacted rather strongly and accidentally ripped off a couple of suckers... big oops. But to be fair, Leroy/Leona looked like they were on their death bed when we pulled 'em up.] Came up in our MOCNESS, from somewhere in the 600-800m of depth range. So the corresponding ocean pressure and temperature changes on the way up were a lot to undergo, to say the least. 


When u talk about ur love life at midnight and get advice from ppl u met only a lil bit ago
Andrew grace and amber agree that our anniversary is first outing date we went on after deciding we should go on dates. So nov 18 for maps and brunch I think

Journal, whales read
Talk to max, feel much better/affirmed
Haven't lived till dance on deck at 2am with the hose as rain. Wee
Leona/lera octo, accidentally ripped off some suckers and ate them
Sunset and sunrise. Omelet hit. Chocolate chickpea for dessert
Could be a Leroy octo. Could be poop? Sperm prob come out of arm, all my recent Google searches are for octopus excretions lol.

*Sea fun fact of the day:*  I've done a lot of research about octopus reproduction and poop recently (trying to figure out what's at the bottom of Leroy/Leona's jar)
