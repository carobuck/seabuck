It's port call day! Well, sort of. We^[the whole ship] aren't going all the way into port, rather we are getting close and then hovering in the water while a small boat comes out to swap some folks. A few gotta get off to head to a conference, and a couple more are getting on to finish out the last week at sea. 

Heading into/near Port Hueneme, we passed between the Channel Islands and California coast and it was quite lovely and beautiful. Water was pretty calm too, so it was smooth sailing into port with a gloriously sunny day. Heading back out to sea after we swapped people was a different story; last night was full of rather rocky seas.^[Thankfully, this time passing Point Conception I was not seasick, so that was very much a win compared to a few weeks ago.]

rocky seas again. no more calm water of the channel islands & land. tho this time around, I'm not seasick so that's a win. 
super windy sunset, but pretty. put pic of madison and I

[Answering some of the people's questions:^[Don't forget, you too can [ask away](https://seabuck.netlify.app/ama)!]]{.subheaders}

*(re bioluminescence) Why only purple glow? Why not blue or green? Is it algae?* So far I've seen blue and purple bioluminescence on this trip. Not sure why/how different colors but 
not sure why diff colors, is due to whatever is making them biolum, and could be chem, what they ate, etc. sooo... research needed?
