The science is done,^[our last MOCNESS was finished in the wee hours of March 17th] the cleaning has begun! You'd think that a mere 16 nets wouldn't be too bad, but when some of the nets are 20+ feet long, and you have to rinse, then scrub with soap^[Grace + giant trash barrel + some dish soap = DIY washing machine], then flip inside out, then rinse the inside, then flip right-side out, then rinse the outside... It is a process to say the least. 

I volunteered as tribute^[meaning I held up the nets while they got their final two rinses] and I got soaked. Like, dump-water-out-of-the-rainboots, abandon-the-rain-pants-because-they're-not-doing-anything-anymore soaked. 

And to round out the day, we had an on-theme St. Patrick's Day meal with the dregs of the food stores. Then we started our transit back to San Diego and land!

*Sea fun fact of the day:*  So I googled why zooplankton smell and learned some interesting tidbits about the role of sulfur in the ocean. Both for good^[exploding plankton release the sulfuric smells, both attracting predators to their next meal and helping to make clouds and regulate earth's temperature] and for less good.^[Some seabirds can smell the sulfur and get confused and then chomp down on plastic because it is covered in algae that also smells sulfuric] If you also wanna fall down this rabbit hole, here's a [video](https://nerdfighteria.info/v/M801n0GpBqQ/) and [article](https://www.audubon.org/news/why-do-some-seabirds-eat-so-much-plastic-it-smells-food) to get you started.
