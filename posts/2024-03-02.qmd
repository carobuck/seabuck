combined 3/1 and 3/2 log. 

hi hi hi. We are in some big boi swells still today/tonight. Our bongo was fine but mocness got pulled in early (we were gonna go super deep to 1500m but didn't even get half that because the net started drifting in the wrong angle with all the bounce from swells on the wire. and that bounce on the wire is dangerous for the nets and the winch sooo.... net came in early. TBH I'm glad it did b/c that meant we finished like 2 hours earlier than we otherwise would've)

finally saw bioluminescence, it was purple. sam and grace not gaslighting me. 

essential ship activities: merch store and decorate cups for shrinkage (will report back w/ before/afer)

sunset pics

moc was gonna be deep (like 1500, w/ 2000m paid out), but then w/ all the swells the wire kept bouncing around and it was getting iffy, and moc start soaring at complete wrong angle (flat/parallel to ocean floor which is not the angle we want for optimal collection, want it more vertical) so we pulled it in early. very lil biomass still, and no real neat-o fish. 

Easy Beauty, by Chlo√© Cooper Jones.

"It is a deft act of erasure to be told how to process a situation by a person who would never experience it." talking about her interaction with a stranger and how she should react to offensive (esp unintentional) comments from able-bodied folks. 

"Bosanquet's third term,'width,' is more abstract. He writes that difficult beauty has the ability to disorder and confuse us by disrupting our habitual ways of thinking and doing and being. Our habits build up our little house of self-importance and difficult beauty floods this house, forcing the spectator to 'endure a sort of dissolution of the conventional world.' To find pleasure in this dissolution requires uncommon strength because it is not always enjoyable to be shown how small and silly your house of self-regard is in the face of bigger and more important things, which is almost everything. Difficult beauty does just this kind of pointed showing. To face this and to recognize it as beauty--even as your habitual view of things, your known world, disintegrates--requires that you learn, Bosanquet writes, to 'feel a liberation in it all; it is partly like a holiday in the mountains or a voyage at sea; the customary scale of everything is changed, and you yourself perhaps are revealed to yourself as a trifling insect or a moral prig."

Author is realizing small beauty all around her w/ her son Wolfgang on the beach:
"We'd not been given perfection, not godliness, not symmetry, nor gracious measurement, not a bad hand, nor a curse; we'd not been given anything other than a life to spend togethery; our lives, not easy or free from pain; we'd been given only a real life, dreadfully normal and sublime, and I would no longer betray its beauty by wishing it otherwise."
appreciate the small mundane bits of life as a bold and dramatic act of embracing beauty

good relationship advice in supporting a partner who's soul-searching and seeking and trying to figure out who they are and how they operate w/in the world:
Author says her husband could've tried to make her come home in all of her itinerant wanderings, but he replies "No, I can only try to be the person you want to come home to." We can't change other people's behavior or actions even if we desperately want to.

[Answering some of the people's questions:^[Don't forget, you too can [ask away](https://seabuck.netlify.app/ama)!]]{.subheaders}

*What is a desk pet?*

*Sea fun fact of the day:* there's a lot of dissolved organic matter in the ocean (whether it be partially degraded phytoplankton or other detritus from photosynthesis or virus-induced when a virus got into something and then blew it up.)
and it's an open question to figure out where this organic matter comes from and where it goes and why it takes so long to degrade (current estimates via carbon dating estimate about 6 thousand years old for this material. so why does it last so long when it cycles through the oceans/between the poles multiple times before somehow going away?)
(thanks to ben for explaining some marine chemistry to me today)
