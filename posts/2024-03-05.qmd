Land ho! Our long transit from yesterday is over and we're back closer to shore for this next cycle.^[Roughly tinkering around in the ocean about 30ish miles off the coast. Off Pismo Beach last I checked.] Being closer to shore, the ocean is ALIVE AND ABUNDANT AGAIN. Like whoa, if you just look over the side of the ship after dark you can see TONS of things drifting/swimming by, some of which are very large. Lots pyrosomes, salp chains, shiny fish, jellyfish, etc. etc.^[aka a bunch of other stuff I can't name, but smart science people on this ship definitely can. Also heard rumor there was a shark swimming around out there tonight, but everytime I went to go look she was gone :( ] Day crew got a ton of pyrosomes and biomass in today's nets, so I was gearing up for a massive haul tonight, because usually we get more at night than during the daytime.^[Due to DVM, diel ... FILL THIS IN CARO. and add ref]. While we did get far more in tonight's nets than we were getting out at the last station for the past few days, we didn't top day crew's hauls. They had hundreds of pyrosomes; we had maybe a hundred total, from all the nets combined? So a lot, but not as much as they had. Their cod ends were PACKED with pyros. Wowzas!

^^ fact check the pyro numbers w/ grace for rough estimates. 

we caught octo. leroy, see email for type. had fam photoshoo t== (we had a moment where he held my finger. the lightest of light touch w/ his suckers. it was so cool, I wanna feel a big one sometime. )

also played my first game in the cribbage tournament; a great game w/ Gabe.^[I won, but we're doing best 2 out of 3 so he's still got a chance for a comeback]

susnet

tried to do the small boat ops (grace wanted to collect pyros), but too choppy so we did a moc instead

also, taco tuesday is maybe my favorite dinner on the ship, and the peach crisp for dessert tonight was the (metaphorical) cherry on top. *SO GOOD* Richard and Jim! Thank you!
