WORDS

final mocness. a lot of baby velellas in the manta tow (add pic) -- nope, not sure if vellela. say grass thing is actually a fish
slimy green stuff pic; remember for posterity all the snot I pulled from mesh.

blurry cloud pic at sunset. bc the clouds were pretty. and blurry bc not everything in life is clear and that's ok. when I returned from sea not everything was clear. and now writing this several months later, some things have changed, some things have remained the same and we all learn and grow and shift. a perfectly clear life wouldn't be a fun, interesting and exciting life. I'm getting philosophical now. but as my notes say, this evening marked the end of an era. 

notes from maxwell emails:
OK, now that that's out of the way. several things:
1. I realized just now that I think I gave myself a sock tan with all my sitting out in the sun reading shenanigans. LOL.
2. I ate my weight in crumble today and I have no regrets (tho I'd really love a crumble without the weird dried fruit chunks that were in this one. but beggars can't be choosers always)
3. the -80 freezers stay on the ship; we tote our goodies (petris and frozen pyrosomes) out in dry ice
4. When I nearly missed the sunset (egads), turns out I also missed a spectacle where they found a dead seal floating by and andrew tried to catch it on a pole. Real bummed I missed this spectacle bc sounded funny. 
5. I chomped a pyrosome tonight. It was my last chance since these were the last nets of the whole cruise. It was a gooey one. Very salty first taste, kinda hard and then liquidy texture, then  the aftertaste is the taste-equivalent of how zoop smell. Not pleasant tbh, but I had to try it. 

End of an era this evening. I'll probably never process another net, or cock another moc. I am so grateful for this experience to see stuff I'd likely never see anywhere else, and yet I also now know that I am a land gal; that I love having my diversity of activities and community and hubbub of 'regular' life. Aaand if I'm honest, I'm excited to have a place to come back home to, and a person (*cough* you *cough*) who feels like home too. I'm glad we're almost at the end of this long-distance thing because it's not always the easiest/most fun; I really like having you in my life in the big and small moments, and I like spending time with you way more often than once a month. Basically, I'm really excited to see you too in a few(ish) days.
