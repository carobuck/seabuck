The last proper day of doing science. Wowzas. 

End of an era this evening. I'll probably never process another net, or cock another moc. I am so grateful for this experience to see stuff I'd likely never see anywhere else, and yet I also now know that I am a land gal; that I love having my diversity of activities and community and hubbub of 'regular' life.

Writing this recap in July 2024,^[Using my notes from sea; I promise, this is the last of the sea logs that was delayed. After this I'm done.] I'm reflecting on this blurry sunset picture. The clouds are pretty and drifty and I almost like the photo better because it is a little blurry.^[I did have alternate sunset pics but this one won] Not everything in life is clear and that is okay. When I returned from sea, not everything was certain and now writing several months later, some things have changed while others have remained the same. Flowers take time to bloom and sometimes we must learn to be patient;^[whether we want to or not] a perfectly clear and steady life wouldn't be as fun, interesting, and unexpected as the life we've been given to live.^[I'm getting philosophical now. But as my notes say, this evening marked the end of an era.]

Some mundane notes from the day: 

- I ate my weight in crumble today and I have no regrets^[tho I'd really love a crumble without the weird dried fruit chunks that were in this one. but beggars can't be choosers]
- When I nearly missed the sunset (egads), turns out I also missed a spectacle^[Real bummed I missed this spectacle because it sounded funny to watch] where they found a dead seal floating by and Andrew tried to catch it on a pole. 
- I chomped a pyrosome tonight. It was my last chance since these were the last nets of the whole cruise. It was a gooey one. Very salty for the first taste, kinda hard and then liquidy texture, then  the aftertaste is the taste-equivalent of how zoop smell.^[like vaguely rotting sea] Honestly, not pleasant but I had to try it.^[Max says "nauseating" but proud of me for trying it]

*Sea fun fact of the day:* That thing that looks like a piece of grass in the Manta tow is actually a fish! Probably a [bay pipefish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_pipefish) if my research is correct.^[I definitely don't remember what we called it when we pulled it up from the ocean]
