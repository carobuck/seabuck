*Sea fun fact of the day:* One of the processing steps for the Bongo net involves pouring a can of seltzer on the critters. Apparently this immediately anesthetizes the organisms so they stop eating each other. Comical. And essential if we want to have any sort of useful sample.^[Though I really hope we'll get to look at some non-seltzered samples under a microscope... from his previous cruises, my dad says this is the really cool stuff to watch: prehistoric-looking bugs chomping down on smaller prehistoric-looking things.]
