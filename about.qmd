TLDR: I'm going to sea and these are the logs of that adventure. Essentially, I've signed myself up to throw things off the side of a ship in all weather and at all hours. The things we do for a good story.

The longer story: 

My parents (and both uncles) all went to maritime academy, so I grew up surrounded by stories of the sea. My dad was at Scripps Institution of Oceanography his whole career, sailing ships all over the world for assorted ocean research. With all these stories, I've always wanted to go to sea but opportunities to do so (especially as someone not in oceanography nor maritime trades) are rare. At the beginning of January, my dad sent me a last-minute opportunity to join a science party for a month at sea, and the potential for a new adventure (and to collect/study zooplankton and other ocean critters) was too far up my alley to not seriously pursue. Though I've got little formal biology experience (I loved AP Bio back in high school), I'm super excited to join the cruise, learn a whole bunch of new stuff, and return to land with my own tales of sea.

(She'll come after me if I don't mention it: my mother also worked on ships and went to sea, but out of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. There's a bit of a rivalry in my family if you're in the know about maritime academy lore lol).

[What ship? How big??]{.subheaders}</br>
After people got over the initial confusion (shock?) that I'm going to sea for a month, the next most frequent question was 'What ship and how big?' I'll be aboard the 273-foot-long [R/V Roger Revelle](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/ships/revelle), known for it's excellent ice cream selection in the galley.^[At least, when I was a kid visiting my dad on the ships, Revelle always seemed to have the good stuff.]
